title: Quick heads-up on our upcoming webinar with Joyent on Manta
---
<p>A few months back, one of our engineers <a href="http://wanelo.com/atasay">Atasay Gokkaya</a>&nbsp;published a <a href="http://building.wanelo.com/post/54110156963/a-cost-effective-approach-to-scaling-event-based-data">fantastic overview</a> of how we at Wanelo use <a href="http://joyent.com">Joyent's</a> new innovative object store <a href="http://www.joyent.com/products/manta">Manta</a> for a massively parallelized user retention analysis, using just a few lines of basic UNIX commands in combination with map/reduce paradigm. &nbsp;</p>


<p>I also recently went onstage with Joyent's VP of Engineering&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cantrill">Bryan Cantrill</a>&nbsp;for a fireside chat at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.joyent.com/blog/wanelo-and-joyent-fireside-at-cloud-beat">VentureBeat&rsquo;s CloudBeat</a>, discussing Wanelo's use of Manta, as well as our excitement about Joyent's cloud. If you missed it, or are interested to learn more about the subject, we're continuing the discussion with a live webinar on Tuesday, October 29th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atasay and I will dive deep into our team's experience using Joyent Manta storage and big data analytics service.</p>
<p>It's an hour-long webinar, and we'll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we solved the problem of user event data collection on a massive scale, and very cheaply</li>
<li>How Joyent Manta storage and big data analytics service allowed us to use the collected data to analyze user behavior and retention over many months, and run our queries in mere minutes</li>
<li>We'll discuss the unique benefits of using Joyent Manta Storage Service, including ease of use, flexibility, performance, and cost-savings</li>
<li>We'll answer any questions from the audience as much as time permits.</li>
</ul>
