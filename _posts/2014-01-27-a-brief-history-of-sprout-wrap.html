title: A Brief History of Sprout Wrap
---
<p>When Wanelo gets a brand new workstation the first thing we install on it is Sprout. Sprout is a collection of OS X-specific recipes that allow you to install common utilities and applications that every Ruby developer has and will appreciate.</p>


<p>Anyone who has worked at Pivotal Labs would feel comfortable with the workstations that spawn from&nbsp;<code>sprout-wrap</code>, because they&rsquo;ve probably worked on one before. Sprout is based on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mkocher/soloist">chef-soloist</a>&nbsp;that allows a developer to run a set of chef recipes from their local machine. Recipes have been built for applications like Chrome, RubyMine and iTerm. Other common OS X settings &mdash; ones that are changed on&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;new workstation &mdash; can be switched, including turning SSH on, changing the default keyboard repeat rate, installing sane git aliases, rbenv and bash completion.</p>
<p>You can automatically clone git repositories into your&nbsp;<code>~/workspace&nbsp;</code>directory. You can install PostgreSQL, ImageMagick, node, Dropbox, PhantomJS, GitX, Caffeine and Heroku Toolbelt. If you&rsquo;ve found a utility useful in a development setting, or flipped a switch somewhere in System Preferences, a recipe probably exists in one of Sprout&rsquo;s cookbooks.</p>
<h2 id="so_who_is_this_useful_for">So who is the useful for?</h2>
<p>We at Wanelo have grown considerably in the last few months I&rsquo;ve been there. We&rsquo;ve hired four new people. That&rsquo;s two pairing stations that two pairs would normally have to set up. Instead, we took the time to set up a<code>soloistrc</code>&nbsp;file &mdash; the file where you specify which recipes to run.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet from a standard&nbsp;<code>soloistrc</code>&nbsp;file:</p>
<pre><code># development (rails)
- pivotal_workstation::rbenv
- pivotal_workstation::gem_setup
- pivotal_workstation::postgres
- sprout-osx-apps::imagemagick
- sprout-osx-apps::node_js
- sprout-osx-apps::qt

# apps
- sprout-osx-apps::skype
- sprout-osx-apps::chrome
- sprout-osx-apps::textmate
- sprout-osx-apps::1password
- sprout-osx-apps::hub
- sprout-osx-apps::phantomjs
- sprout-osx-apps::gitx
- sprout-osx-apps::propane</code></pre>
<p>Running&nbsp;<code>bundle exec soloist</code>&nbsp;inside the proper directory will ensure all applications are installed. After unboxing new workstations (or formatting the out-of-date ones) a full run of sprout-wrap takes about two and a half hours. Subsequently, each run takes about 3 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="customize">Customize!</h2>
<p>At Wanelo we wrote a recipe that runs&nbsp;<code>bundle install</code>&nbsp;and sets up our development database. It gets our Ruby web application to a state where we can run&nbsp;<code>foreman start</code>&nbsp;on a brand new machine. We also wrote a recipe that installs our VPN on our machines. The most recent recipe we wrote installs our favorite vim plugins, configurations and theme.</p>
<h2 id="we_have_reached_convergence">We have reached convergence</h2>
<p>Sprout-wrap has the benefit of following chef&rsquo;s principles and requires recipes to be idempotent. So when a developer includes the recipes that, for instance, installs&nbsp;<code>cowsay</code>, going forward each workstation will now have cowsay. Which means every developer is happy to work on any workstation. Because, hey, now you have cowsay on every workstation.</p>
<pre><code>&lt; Moo. &gt;
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||</code></pre>
<p>Sprout enables us as pairing developers to build a stable cluster of similar machines where there are minimal development bottlenecks. Having someone who is familiar and can set up sprout-wrap on your machines is hugely valuable for a growing organization, and can save hours, likely&nbsp;<em>days, </em>of developers' time.</p>
