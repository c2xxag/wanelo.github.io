title: Scaling Wanelo 100x in Six Months
---
<p>We recently gave a talk at the SFRoR Meetup here in San Francisco about how we scaled this rails app to 200K RPM in six months. There were a lot of excellent questions at the meetup, and so we decided to put the slides up on SlideShare.</p>


<p>Without further ado, here it is. Feedback and comments are always welcome.</p>
