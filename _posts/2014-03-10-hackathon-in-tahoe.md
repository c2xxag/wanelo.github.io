title: Lake Tahoe is Perfect for fun, skiing, and... hackathons :)
---

This week entire Wanelo crew packed up and went up to Tahoe City, a small town on the
shore of beautiful Lake Tahoe. We've done a hackathon before, but never outside of
our main office HQ in San Francisco.

On Sunday after dinner everyone pitched their ideas and tried to get a team assembled
to work on a project. There have been a total of 19 project submissions, and given that
we have 15 engineers, I would call this a huge success.

Tomorrow evening we'll have demos and presentations, with prizes and celebration,
which I am very much looking forward to. Stay tuned for some amazing results :)
