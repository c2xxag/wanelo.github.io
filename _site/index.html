This week entire Wanelo crew packed up and went up to Tahoe City, a small town on the
shore of beautiful Lake Tahoe. We’ve done a hackathon before, but never outside of
our main office HQ in San Francisco.</p>

        <blockquote><p>When Wanelo gets a brand new workstation the first thing we install on it is Sprout. Sprout is a collection of OS X-specific recipes that allow you to install common utilities and applications that every Ruby developer has and will appreciate.</p>

        <blockquote><p><span>Deploying at Wanelo tends to be high-frequency and low-stress, since we have most aspects of our systems performance graphed in real time. We can roll out new code to a percentage of app servers, monitor app server and db performance, check error rates, and then finish up the deploy.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>However, there&rsquo;s one area where I&rsquo;ve always wanted better metrics: on the client side. In particular, I want better visibility into uncaught JavaScript exceptions. Client-side error tracking is a notoriously difficult problem -- browser extensions can throw errors, adding noise to your reports; issues may manifest only in certain browsers or with certain network conditions; exception messages tend to be generic, and line-numbers are unhelpful, since scripts are usually minified; data has to be captured and collected from users&rsquo; browsers and reported via http before a user navigates to a new page.</span> And on and on.<br /><br /><span>On the other hand, many sites are moving more and more functionality client-side these days, so it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly important to know when there are problems in the browser.</span>

        <blockquote><p>MRI Ruby has a global interpreter lock (GIL), meaning that even when writing multi-threaded Ruby only a single thread is on-CPU at a point in time. Other distributions of Ruby have done away with the GIL, but even in MRI threads can be useful. The <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a> background worker gem takes advantage of this, running multiple workers in separate threads within a single process.<br /> <br /> If the workload of a job blocks on I/O, Ruby can context-switch to other threads and do other work until the I/O finishes. This could happen when the workload reaches out to an external API, shells out to another command, or is accessing the file system.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> If the workload of a process does not block on I/O, it will not benefit from thread switching under a GIL, as it will be, instead, CPU-bound. In this case, multiple processes will be more efficient, and will be able to take better advantage of multi-core systems.<br /> <br /> So&hellip; why not skip threads and just deal with processes? A number of reasons.</p>

        <blockquote><p>We recently ran into a tricky situation with a custom SMF service we maintain on our Joyent SmartOS hosts. &nbsp;The namespace for the service instance (defined in upstream code) had changed, which meant that as our Chef automation upgraded the service instances to the latest code, we ended up with a lot of duplicate service instances that each had a unique namespace.</p>

        <blockquote><p>With millions of people now using Wanelo across various platforms, collecting and analyzing user actions and events becomes a pretty fun problem to solve. While in most services user actions generate some aggregated records in database systems and keeping those actions non-aggregated is not explicitly required for the product itself, it is critical for other reasons such as user history, behavioral analytics, spam detection and ad hoc querying.</p>

        <blockquote><p>At Wanelo we are pretty ardent fans of PostgreSQL database server, but try not to be dogmatic about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have personally used PostgreSQL since version 7.4, dating back to some time in 2003 or 4. I was always impressed with how easy it was to get PostgreSQL installed on a UNIX system, how quick it was to configure (only two config files to edit), and how simple it was to create and authenticate users.</p>

        <blockquote><p><span>The <a href="http://wanelo.com">Wanelo</a> you see today is a completely different website than the one that existed a few months ago. It&rsquo;s been rewritten and rebuilt from the ground up, as part of a process that took about two months. We thought we&rsquo;d share the details of what we did and what we learned, in case someone out there ever finds themselves in a similar situation, weighing the risks of either working with a legacy stack or going full steam ahead with a rewrite.</span><br /><span></span></p>
