<p>This past weekend a number of us were focused on a really important annual prime time television event (the <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/puppy-bowl" title="Puppy Bowl" target="_blank">Puppy Bowl</a>, of course). Turns out other people out there were watching some other sporting event, which leads to the rest of this story.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Wanelo's recent surge in popularity rewarded our engineers with a healthy stream of scaling problems to solve.</p>
<p>Among the many performance initiatives launched over the last few weeks, vertical sharding has been the most impactful and interesting so far.</p>

        <blockquote><p><span>The <a href="http://wanelo.com">Wanelo</a> you see today is a completely different website than the one that existed a few months ago. It&rsquo;s been rewritten and rebuilt from the ground up, as part of a process that took about two months. We thought we&rsquo;d share the details of what we did and what we learned, in case someone out there ever finds themselves in a similar situation, weighing the risks of either working with a legacy stack or going full steam ahead with a rewrite.</span><br /><span></span></p>
